Our new libraries collection is opening with [seven projects](/libs) connected to the BombBomb application release
pipeline. These machine-generated libraries are made possible by our API's offering of an OpenAPI specification. 
Node, Python, Ruby and PHP even get native packages ready in automatically install in your project with more to come!

## API
The API represented on this site is BombBomb's new V2 API. Our V1 API of modest origins has gotten us quite far and
serves millions of requests per day. V1's design is a bit rustic by modern standards, though, so we charge towards the
next decade with a RESTful little sportster, [API V2](/api), combined with a new [OAuth2 security system](/auth).

## More to come
We're very excited about this new suite of products, to learn more, get involved or get help on 
[our developer slack team.](http://slack.developer.bombbomb.com)
